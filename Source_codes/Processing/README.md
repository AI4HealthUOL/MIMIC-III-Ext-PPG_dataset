# 🧠 Physiological Signal Quality Assessment & Feature Extraction

The following repository is a modular and extensible Python pipeline for processing and analyzing physiological signals, including ABP, ECG, PPG, and RESP. This toolkit is part of our **MIMIC-III-EXt-PPG** project. It incorporates advanced preprocessing, signal quality assessment, and feature extraction with NeuroKit2 integrated for peak detection and signal cleaning where applicable.

## Signal Processing Workflow

The pipeline processes each 30/10s-second segment of physiological signals, validates and scores their quality, and extracts clinically relevant metrics.

## 📁 Project Modules

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `run_features_task.py` | Entry point for batch processing 30-second signal segments.|

| `utils.py` | General-purpose utilities for NaN handling, signal validation, clipping, padding, and WFDB signal loading. |
| `abp_utils.py` | ABP-specific utilities for beat detection, SBP/DBP identification, physiological plausibility filtering, and SQI evaluation. |
| `resp_utils.py` | RESP signal preprocessing and SQI based on template similarity and breathing cycle consistency. |
| `sqi_utils.py` | Central dispatch for signal quality assessment (ABP, ECG, PPG, RESP), using template correlation or physiology-based rules. |
| `plotting_utils.py` | Tools to visualize ABP, ECG, and RESP signals with annotations for peaks, troughs, and fiducial points. |

## 🧪 Analysis Details

### 🔹 30-Second Window
Used for:
- 📈 RR interval analysis (median & IQR) from RESP
- ✅ SQI computation for RESP

### 🔹 10-Second Sub-Windows
Each 30s window is split into three 10s segments to extract:
- 🩺 SBP / DBP (median & IQR)
- ❤️ Heart Rate (HR) from ECG
- 🔦 PPG SQI, ABP SQI, and ECG SQI

All 10s-based metrics are stored as time-resolved vectors:
```python
vector_10s_sbp = [SBP_10s_1, SBP_10s_2, SBP_10s_3]
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Place the address of WFDB files in `WFDB_folder/`, and the output folder of`.npy` PPG signals in `PPG_npy_folder/`.
2. Set `meta_data_path`, `start_index`, and `end_index` in `main.py`.
3. Run:
